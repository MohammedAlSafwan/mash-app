# Vention MachineCloud test

This test will consist of building a very simple application which represents a marketplace.

## Sneak Peek

![project appropriation success](readme-assets/final-look.png)

## What you need to build

- [x] An application using React that will display a list of items that you can add to your cart
- [x] When you add an item to your cart it should be represented in the UI
- [x] You should be able to remove products from the cart
- [x] You must add the ability to rate products with a score from (1 to 5)
- [x] Provide instructions in the README to launch the application

## Bonus points

- [x] **Use TypeScript**
- [x] Implement a backend and persist the state in a database
- [x] Have a single command to launch the whole application
- [x] Use the open-source project [stator](https://github.com/chocolat-chaud-io/stator) as a template for your application

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) >=14.x <15.0.0

## Run the application

### From Script

simply run:

```
sh install.sh
```

### Manually

1- Install the dependencies:

```
npm i
```

2- Build:

```
npm run build
```

3- Run

```
docker compose up
```

## Notes and Discussion

- In the initial `docker-compose` file, we had the `nginx` as a `Load Balancer`. In our case, it is not needed. The stack is running locally.
- `Web-app` is running on port `8081`. Port `80` might be used by other apps.
- `API` is running on port `3333`.
- The app is made as simple as possible. However, in a production app:
  - `Cart` would have it is own table. In our simple app, it was a simple `slice` + simple boolean in `Item` object.
  - `User` rating for single `Item` would be stored in a saperate table and computed for every `Item` when needed.
